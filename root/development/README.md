It aims to help you organize yours software development process.

    - archive: past projects keep just for references or because you like them
    - forks: just repos dowload or fork from GitHub
    - tutorials: keep the tutorials that you've followed on internet.

You may have a folder for work projects called ''work'' or to personal projects -- guess what! called personal. This is up to you.
